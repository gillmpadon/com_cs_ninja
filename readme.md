## Story

Once upon a time, in a land known as Dragon's Reach, a peaceful realm thrived under the protection of a benevolent dragon. The dragon, a majestic creature with shimmering scales and eyes that gleamed like precious gems, had forged an unspoken bond with the people of the land. For centuries, the dragon watched over the kingdom, ensuring harmony and prosperity.

But as time went on, a darkness began to fester within the heart of the dragon. Consumed by an unquenchable thirst for power, the once benevolent creature turned into a fearsome beast of destruction. Its eyes, once filled with wisdom and compassion, now burned with a fiery rage that threatened to engulf the entire land.

News of the dragon's descent into madness spread like wildfire, reaching the ears of Hiroshi, Ryota, Kazuki, Takumi, Sakura, Hikari, and Aya. Each of them possessed unique abilities and powers that made them the kingdom's last hope against the dragon's tyranny.

I am thrilled to introduce myself as the creator of an exciting web application called CS Ninja. My name is Gillbert Padon, and I am a passionate student developer who embarked on this web development journey to bring a unique and engaging experience to coding enthusiasts like myself.

CS Ninja is a captivating game that combines programming challenges with strategic gameplay. It is designed to enhance coding skills while providing an immersive and fun environment. As a student developer, I wanted to create an app that not only entertains but also educates and inspires players to become coding ninjas.

The idea behind CS Ninja was to develop a platform where players can control a team of brave warriors with distinct abilities and powers. These characters include Hiroshi, Ryota, Kazuki, Takumi, Sakura, Hikari, Aya, and Yumi. Each of them possesses unique strengths, such as lightning magic, wind manipulation, stealth, and more. Players can guide these heroes through exciting quests, answering programming questions to earn points and level up their characters.
