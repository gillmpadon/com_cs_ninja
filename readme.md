[Project Brief Information]

## Story

Once upon a time, in a land known as Dragon's Reach, a peaceful realm thrived under the protection of a benevolent dragon. The dragon, a majestic creature with shimmering scales and eyes that gleamed like precious gems, had forged an unspoken bond with the people of the land. For centuries, the dragon watched over the kingdom, ensuring harmony and prosperity.

But as time went on, a darkness began to fester within the heart of the dragon. Consumed by an unquenchable thirst for power, the once benevolent creature turned into a fearsome beast of destruction. Its eyes, once filled with wisdom and compassion, now burned with a fiery rage that threatened to engulf the entire land.

News of the dragon's descent into madness spread like wildfire, reaching the ears of Hiroshi, Ryota, Kazuki, Takumi, Sakura, Hikari, and Aya. Each of them possessed unique abilities and powers that made them the kingdom's last hope against the dragon's tyranny.
